                <description>LIT LIT LIT LIT Avenue 165 East Hastings St. Vancouver BC - Zebulon Zang, Kara Hansen, Alex Bovril, and Steffanie Ling. April 18th 2015 8:00pm. Asked to write a biography to accompany a reading, the writer can’t think of anything to write about himself. Does he give the names of cities, institutions, achievements? What achievements? He steps out for fresh air. During, a car (on which the painter’s ladders are piled) drives up. The writer asks the painter for help with the biography and the painter agrees, but they end up talking only about window cleaning. The painter wishes he could write: when you do condos you’re cleaning these windows that take, like, half a minute, and all day long briefly glimpsing hundreds of bedrooms, which is to say of hundreds of unconnected lives—or lives that just seemed unconnected but which in writing could take on connections—the painter gets to thinking. They finish enjoying the fresh air and part ways, the writer still not knowing what to say about himself. For now, Alex Bovril is a writer currently based in New York. Kara Hansen is an artist and writer living in Nanaimo and based in Vancouver. Currently she holds the position of Curatorial Intern at the Nanaimo Art Gallery. She and Jesse Birch are co-curating an exhibition entitled Spirit Gum at the Nanaimo Art Gallery come May. From time to time she bribes the karaoke guy with flowers for two songs instead of one. Steffanie Ling is a writer, curator and editor. She will have red wine and turtlenecks all year long. For LIT LIT LIT LIT she will be reading from work in process, tentatively titled “You’re a liar and a smoker” a book of twenty chapters for twenty cigarettes. Zebulon Zang is a filmmaker and writer from Maillardville, British Columbia. He is also the founder of the Maillardville Cultural Appreciation Society, an exhibition space dedicated to the promotion of culture in peripheral zones.</description>

Zuzia Juszkiewicz is a fragment in some kind of multi-faceted hybrid zone or something. She was born in Gdansk, and raised in South Africa, New Zealand, and Canada. She holds a BA in Visual Arts (Vancouver), Human Geography (Vancouver) and Urbanism at AHK (Amsterdam). She collaborates with writers, musicians, filmmakers and dancers. She often works under the name Modern Catalyst, with a focus on designing cross-disciplined artists.http://modercatalyst.ca . Ronan K. Nanning-Watson is a filmmaker, writer and artist from British Columbia. His work ranges in scope, medium, and aesthetic, but is consistently uncompromising. Recently he finished his first feature film “Crusade” about a group of young hipsters who start a holy war. The next two parts in the trilogy are in preproduction. Ingrid Olauson is a writer and trawler of people’s lives. She recently wrote, produced and acted in the play and collaborative art piece Fort Eff, which debuted at Deep Blue this past May. </description>

                <description>LIT LIT LIT LIT Publication Studio: 222 E Georgia St. Vancouver BC - ALEX BOVRIL is a writer and visual artist. Recently, he has been pouring colours of concrete and writing fiction. He is currently an MFA Candidate in Creative Writing at New York University.

DONATO MANCINI makes visual and procedural poetry, bookworks, and visual art. His books and chapbooks include: Snowline (2015), Buffet World (2011) Fact ‘N’ Value (2011), Hell Passport no.22 (2008), Æthel (2007), 58 Free Coffees (2006) and Ligatures (2005). Mancini’s published critical writing includes work on the archive, time and memory in Anamnesia: Unforgetting (2011), and a discourse analysis of poetry reviews in You Must Work Harder to Write Poetry of Excellence (2012). His most recent full length book, Loitersack (2014), is a labyrinthine commonplace book where critical, theoretical and para-literary tendencies intersect in the forms of poetry, poetics, theory, theory theatre, laugh particles and many many questions.

KATE MOSS is an Australian artist who works with drawing, writing, painting, sculpture, sound and performance. Her works explore the possibilities of conversation through the vernacular of landscape, rhythm and material experimentation.

MAIA NICHOLS (b. Berkeley, California) is an artist and writer. She holds a BA in Psychology and a BFA from the University of British Columbia. She is a Masters Candidate in the Department of Critical Studies at California Institute of the Arts. Her work is currently on view at Fundación Botín’s Villa Iris in Spain</description>
